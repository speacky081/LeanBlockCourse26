# Formalized Math in LEAN – FUB Block Course 2026

## Announcements

- Uploaded slides for `P01_Introduction` *2025-03-02*

## General notes

This is the second time this course is being held. The structure will largely follow last year's with some additions and modifications, but is nevertheless subject to (spontaneous) change. Constructive feedback is welcomed throughout the course and afterwards.

### Teaching team

[Christoph Spiegel](https://christophspiegel.berlin) will teach this course. He is a researcher at ZIB in Prof. Pokutta's IOL group, working on combinatorics, optimization, machine learning, and proof formalization. [Silas Rathke](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/geokomb/People/PhD-Students/Silas_Rathke.html) will serve as the teaching assistant. He is a Ph.D. student at FUB in Prof. Szabo's group, focusing on extremal combinatorics and related formalization projects.

### Time and venue

The course takes place from **Monday the 2nd of March** to **Friday the 13th of March 2026**, split into two daily sessions (9:30–12:30 and 14:00–17:00). It will be held in **Seminarraum 119 (A3/SR 119) at Arnimallee 3** on the FUB Dahlem Campus.

### Registration and credit

The course is open to everyone, including guest auditors (Gasthörer), not just those who need it for their degree. Priority will be given to FU students who need the course as part of their ABV degree program. The course will also be offered for **Master students at the FUB** as well as as a **BMS Advanced Course** for the first time this year!

For the `aktive Teilnahme`, Master-level participants will be required to solve additional and more advanced problems in the exercise sessions compared to Bachelor-level students. Both Bachelor and Master-level students will sit the same **final exam on the second Friday**. Master-level students will additionally receive a **small formalization project** to complete in the one or two weeks following the course. The exact scope and evaluation format has not yet been determined but may include an in-person presentation.

### Prerequisites

Completion of Analysis I and Linear Algebra I should provide a sufficient mathematical background, though participants should have a strong command of these subjects, as formal proof verification is very "unforgiving". No prior programming experience is required, but a certain technical affinity and interest is needed. Besides formal proof verification, you will be in contact with many other tools such as `git` and `github`, [Patrick Massot's](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~patrick.massot/en/) `leanblueprint`, CI/CD in the form of `github Actions`, as well as various ML tools.

Participants need to **bring a laptop** to follow along and work on exercises. The course will be **conducted in English**, but Bachelor students taking the course as part of their ABV requirements may express themselves in German if they prefer.

## Course Outline

The course outline is still subject to change, but will roughly be as follows:

1) General introduction, or: why formalize maths?
1) The tech stack, or: how to properly organize a formalization project?
1) Foundations of Logic in LEAN, or: what is a type and what does being classical vs. intuitionistic mean?
1) Set theory in LEAN, or: why you should rarely do set theory in LEAN
1) Natural numbers in LEAN, or: why inductive types are so powerful.
1) **Formalization Example** The infinitude of primes, or: your first real proof in LEAN.
1) **Formalization Example** The handshaking lemma, or: graph theory and combinatorics in LEAN.
1) **Examination** Final exam and distribution of small formalization projects for Master-level students.
1) **Optional** An example on how to contribute to mathlib.
